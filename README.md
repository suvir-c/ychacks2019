# React Boilerplate Echo
<br/>

This boilerplate was created to make developing in react simple and as fast as possible, without 
having all the overhead of larger boilerplates. It was built off of a larger boilerplate called [react-boilerplate](https://github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate). This is my simplification of that boilerplate.

### Starting
1. Clone or download this Github repo
2. Run `npm install` or `yarn install`
3. Run `npm start` or `yarn start`
4. Open `http://localhost:3000/`
5. Get developing!

### Features
- Hot reloading, so that your code will automatically be rendered in the browser whenever you save your files
- SCSS Support
- Linting, for clean coding practices
- Travis for continuous integration
- Webpack for precompilation

### Styling

There's two ways of styles. You can include the stylesheet in your component folder adjacent to your `index.js` file for
that component, or you can add another stylesheet to the `app/stylesheets` folder and then include that file
in the `_all.scss` file in the corresponding component or container folder. The first way is easier and recommended.

### Server

You can create a backend using Express.js as well.
